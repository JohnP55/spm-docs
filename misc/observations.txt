Assertions were left in the final build of the game (Shift-JIS)

Removing relF.bin and adding a decompressed relF.rel will cause the game to use that instead

The rel always loads in the same place

All memory addresses match between PAL revision 0 and 1 (dol is identical, rel has 1 float value changed)

The game's code files generally follow a common structure:
    Variables stored inside a work struct
    They usually have Entry structures used to control them
    Init functions called in spmarioInit
    ReInit called in places like _unload
    Main function called in spmarioMain
