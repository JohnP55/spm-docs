Assertions were left in the final build of the game (Shift-JIS)

Removing relF.bin and adding a decompressed relF.rel will cause the game to use that instead

The rel always seems to load in the same place in memory?

The game's code files generally follow a common structure:
    Variables stored inside a work struct
    Init & ReInit functions called in spmarioInit
    Main function called in spmarioMain
